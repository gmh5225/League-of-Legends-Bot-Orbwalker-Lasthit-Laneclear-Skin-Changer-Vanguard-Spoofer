Now that we are all on the same page as to what LOL is all about and the basic idea behind it, let’s dive into scripting. Scripting is a program written to take over the actions of your in-game character. The basic idea is the same as that of an NPC (non-player character), in that NPC’s are controlled by the programming and do not need to be guided by a player. These bots carry out actions and perform their role based on pre-determined criteria, and do not need moment-by-moment control. Take this idea and apply it to the character you control. With scripting, you can get assistance in performing difficult combination moves or limit the reaction time when a specified event takes place.
